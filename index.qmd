This example illustrates the **required** metadata by [`methodshub`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/methodshub).

## Execution of R code

```{r}
1 + 1
```

## Creation of figure with R

```{r}
plot(rnorm(10), rnorm(10))
```

## Dependencies

Packages that need to be installed for the reader should be listed in the `install.R` file. For example, with

```r
install.packages("xml2")
```

in the `install.R` file, is possible to execute

```{r}
library(xml2)

html_page <- read_html("<html><title>Hi<title></html>")

xml_name(html_page)
```
